Abstraction : 
    => An abstraction in C++ is the process of hiding the internal implementations and displaying only the required details.
    => For example, when you send an important message through email, at that time only writing and clicking the send option is used.
       This outcome is just the success message that is displayed to confirm you that your email has been sent. However,
       the process followed in transferring the data through email is not displayed because it is of no use to you.

Abstract classes and Abstract methods :

  => An abstract class is a class that is declared with abstract keyword.
  => An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.
  => An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
  => A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass,thus making overriding compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract.
  => Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.
  => There can be no object of an abstract class.That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator.
  => An abstract class can have parametrized constructors and default constructor is always present in an abstract class.

Advantages of Abstraction :

    => It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.
    => Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
    => Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.
