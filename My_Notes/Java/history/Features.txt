Features of any programming language is nothing but the services or basic facilities provided by the language to the programmers.

The java language provides the following Features:

    => Simple:
       1. Java is Simple programming language.
       2. Because all the difficult concepts of c and c++ have been omitted in java.
       3. For example , the concept of pointers

    => Protable:
       1. If a program yields the same result on every machine, then that program is called protable.

    => High performance:
       1. The problem with the interpeter inside the jvm is that slow.
       2. Because of this , java programs are slow.
       3. To overcome this problem, along with the interpeter , javasoft people has introduced JIT(just in time)
          compiler , which enhace the speed of execution. so, now in jvm, both interpeter and JIT compiler work together to run the program.
     
    => platform independent:
       1. If a program yields the same result on every machine, then that program is called protable.

    => secure :  
       1. Security problems like eaves dropping, tampering, impersonation, and virus threats can be eliminated or minimized by using java on internet.

    => Dynamic loading : (java works on Dynamic loading)
       1. The concept of allocating the memory space and loading all the functionalities to the Ram dymanic at the run-time.
    => Static loading : ( java does not work on Static loading)
       1. The concept of allocating the memory space and loading all the functionalities to the Ram dymanic before the program execution.

    => Distributed :
       1. Information is Distributed on various computers in a network.
       2. Using Java, we can write programs, which caputure Information and Distribute it to the client.
       3. This is possible with java Because , java can handle protocals like TCP/UDP.
